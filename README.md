| 1      |       I ran npm init -y to create the package.json in the folder where I created the project. |
| 2      |                 I installed next, react, react-dom, typescript, @types/react and @types/node. |
| 3      |                                      I created tsconfig.json file with a basic configuration. |
| 4      | I created a folder named pages and inside a file index.tsx which is the home path of the app. |
| 5      |                                                        I added eslint and jest configuration. |
| 6      |                                   I modified package.json scripts to start the app with next. | 
## Notes:

1 - Considering that "Min value and max value can't cross in range", it was thought that they could never have the same value at both ends.
